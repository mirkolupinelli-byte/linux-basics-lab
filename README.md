This repository documents my first steps with Linux Server.

## What I did
- Installed Ubuntu Server 24.04 on VirtualBox
- Worked without GUI using terminal
- Managed files, permissions, and users
- Configured SSH (systemd socket activation)
- Connected remotely via SSH using NAT port forwarding
- Set up SSH key-based authentication (ed25519)
- Hardened SSH configuration (disabled password and root login)

## Goal
Build solid Linux fundamentals for a future IT/sysadmin role.
